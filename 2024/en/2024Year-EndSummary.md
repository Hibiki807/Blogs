# 2024 Year-End Summary

I'm not great at expressing myself, so let's have a casual chat, more like an end-of-year informal reflection ^^

### Work-wise

This is essentially my first official year of work, employed at a small company. The salary isn't high, working for a foreign boss. Due to minimal workload, the company mysteriously expanded the team, and with a super-competitive team lead, I basically spent half of each month slacking off. Initially, I thought it was nice to have a low-stress job, but recently something feels off. Whether it's lack of exercise or too much phone time, I've been feeling dizzy and disconnected. I'm gradually realizing this job might not suit me and needs careful consideration. But hey, I've still got credit card debt to pay, so I'll keep at it for now...

Hoping I don't get picked for the company year-end performance, please no!

### Life-wise

Not much to share, totally burned out. The game I played most this year was Civilization 6, just mindlessly killing time. I dropped 'Blue Archive' and 'Nikke: Goddess of Victory' this year. As I always say, gacha games have zero gameplay, relying purely on storylines and community hype. This year's 'Gakuen iDOLM@STER!' was pretty good though, the 3D was impressive. My gaming approach has completely changed - no more daily logins or mandatory tasks, just playing when I feel like it. Much more relaxing now, I don't want a second job after work.

By year-end, I've gained a lot of weight. Started at 68kg when joining the company, now over 80kg, nearly in the overweight BMI range. Started doing daily exercises recently.

Honestly didn't watch many anime this year, but a few left a deep impression: 'Girls Band Cry', 'Too Many Losing Heroines!', 'Dandadan', 'Dragon Ball Daima'. When you think the industry is dying, it always proves that money solves everything - just believe, and it's done~

### First Times This Year
